    <h1>The Stray Animal Crisis</h1>

    <div class="First-p">
         <p>Every day, thousands of cats and dogs are left to survive alone on the streets. 
            Some were abandoned by their owners, while others were born without ever knowing the safety of a home. 
            These stray animals struggle with hunger, disease, injuries, and harsh weather conditions. 
            Many also face abuse or neglect from people who see them as pests instead of living beings.</p>

         <p>In the Philippines, the number of stray animals has grown from about 12 million in 2019 to over 13 million as of 2024. 
            This rise not only affects animal welfare but also creates a serious health risk to humans, especially through rabies, which continues to spread in areas with poor vaccination coverage. 
            Reports show that limited funding and a lack of accessible veterinary care make it difficult to control the growing population of strays.</p>

    <div class="Left2-p">
         <p>The problem is not only seen locally but also around the world. 
            In South Africa, there are more than 4 million stray animals, making up around 22% of the pet population. 
            In Singapore, over 2,000 animals were victims of abuse or neglect in 2024, the highest number of cruelty cases recorded in more than ten years.</p>

         <p>Despite these challenges, many efforts are being made to improve the lives of stray animals. 
            Government leaders, organizations, and volunteers across the Philippines are taking action to protect and care for them. 
            Senator Grace Poe has proposed the creation of an Animal Welfare Bureau to ensure proper funding and management for animal protection. 
            Senator Mark Villar’s Senate Bill 2257 also aims to give tax incentives to adopters of stray or impounded animals, which encourages more people to adopt and reduces overcrowding in shelters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Scnd-p">
         <p>Groups such as the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) continue to lead rescue missions, adoption programs, and vaccination drives to control the spread of diseases and promote responsible pet ownership. 
            Local volunteers and shelters also organize donation drives, educational campaigns, and adoption events to spread awareness and give strays a second chance at life.</p>

         <p>The growing number of strays remains a serious problem, but these efforts show that change is possible. 
            Through continuous awareness, compassion, and teamwork, we can help build a safer and kinder community for both animals and people.</p>
